<img src="MDAG.png" align="right" width="150" />

This workshop will focus on aspects of the open-source scientific and technical publishing system, Quarto. Various output formats and best practices of each will be considered to firstly create static output for documents, followed by principles to adapt static documents to dynamic output such as HTML presentations. Strategies to optimally use qmd documents collaboratively with GitHub will be given. Finally, tips will be provided to construct personal websites using Quarto and GitHub with automatic updating capabilities.

**Organisers**: 

Sean van der Merwe, Raeesa Ganey and Johané Nienkemper-Swanepoel
